  "description": "Fat Lama relies heavily on our search in order for users to be able to find the items they need. The main two factors in the search are: - **Text match**: the user types a word or phrase that they want to find, and the search returns items that match this. - **Location**: the user indicates their location (through geolocation or through typing in the location search box) and the search returns items near the user",
